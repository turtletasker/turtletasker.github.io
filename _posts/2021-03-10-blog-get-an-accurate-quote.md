## What information should I share with the vendors to get an accurate quote? 

A crucial step in hiring the right service professional for your home project is getting the right pricing. Knowing how to request a quote and sharing as much information as possible with your service professional is the right way to get an accurate quote. Listing every little detail about the project and communicating with your vendor on the call will definitely help you get the response you want. And it will also let your service professional know that you truly mean business. 

It’s best that you communicate all your concerns and queries with your service professional before or after sending the quote request. And respond to your vendor’s call every time, in case they need any more information to respond to your quote request. Apart from that, here are some things you may need to include in your quote request to get the best possible quote. 

### ☆ Project Details 

Add as much detail about the project as possible. Highlight things you are looking for, add pictures of the project site and share all the necessary details. For instance, if you are looking to hire a plumber for a bathroom repair project, include photos of the bathroom and details about the tasks. 

It’s best to start your message like this:  "Hi, I am vinod. I am looking for a plumber who could repair three leaky faucets and a flush tank in my first-floor bathroom." 

Add pictures of the faucets and the flush tank. Also, mention deadlines if you want to set any. 

### ☆ Numbers

Always remember to add quantities and budget range. For instance, if you are looking to hire a carpenter, mention the number of tasks you want to get done. Because the cost per unit usually decides the overall cost of the project. It’s best if you also mention a reasonable range in your quote request. 

Here’s an example:
“I am looking for someone who could build cabinet-style wardrobes in 3 bedrooms. I am not looking for something very fancy, just a two-door hanging wardrobe in all three rooms. My budget range for this project is ₹500-₹700” 

### ☆ Customized Details of Your Project

If you are looking for a service professional who could work according to your taste, mention your personal preferences in the request. For instance, if you have any sketches, photos, and patterns related to your project, concisely arrange all the information in a document and attach it to your quote request. Making an organized document will also help you approach different service professionals at once. You can send this document to various service providers and wait for a response. This way, you can easily compare prices and choose a service that suits your budget.
